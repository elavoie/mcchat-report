\chapter*{\centering Abstract}

This project aimed to evaluate the quality of the MaidSafe libraries for building distributed peer-to-peer systems by developing an instant messaging application. Unfortunately, the state of the libraries is such that resolving deployment issues during the initial performance evaluation of the Routing library took most of the time available for the project, which left no time to implement and document the intended application. This report therefore describes the intended application, deployment issues both solved and remaining, as well as some initial performance results obtained using the 10th of October development version. 

The major conclusion of that report, is that despite the remarkable quality of support given by the MaidSafe developers, the libraries were not mature and stable enough to be easily deployed and used on available lab machines, in the time constraints of the McGill Distributed System (COMP-512) course in which the project took place. The experience gained in trying to deploy and debug a distributed peer-to-peer application suggests that a common reliable inexpensive distributed platform for developing peer-to-peer applications would greatly facilitate and accelerate the development of such systems by helping external contributors test the system and developers replicate test experiments to identify and fix problematic issues. The development of such a platform is not only possible but probably key to the timely and widespread success of the next generation of secure peer-to-peer applications for end-users.
