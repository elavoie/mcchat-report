\textit{Overall, it is fair to say that there is no general agreement about what “is” and what “is not” peer-to-peer.} -- Stephanos Androutsellis and al.~\cite{Androutsellis-Theotokis:2004}.

\section{Limitations of prototype}
TBD: Explain the tradeoffs that were made to get the implementation working within the time constraints.

\section{Technical problems encountered}

TBD: List of problems encountered and solutions that might be useful for other projects intending to use MaidSafe libraries.

\section{Suitability of MaidSafe libraries for building peer-to-peer systems}
TBD: Reflect on the results of the evaluation, the experience of building an application to criticize if the libraries are ready to build real-world applications.

\section{Future work for MaidSafe libraries}
TBD: Suggest extensions to the current system and implementation to increase reliability and performance.

%\subsection{Security Proofs}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Proof that the key algorithms are correct
%	\item Proof that the implementation is faithful to the algorithms
%	\item Proof that the optimizations preserve the algorithms
%\end{itemize}
