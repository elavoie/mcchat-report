\chapter{Evaluation}

\textit{Peer-to-peer systems are distributed systems consisting of interconnected nodes able to self- organize into network topologies with the purpose of sharing resources such as content, CPU cycles, storage and bandwidth, capable of adapting to failures and accommodating transient popula- tions of nodes while maintaining acceptable con- nectivity and performance, without requiring the intermediation or support of a global centralized server or authority.} -- Androutsellis and al.~\cite{Androutsellis-Theotokis:2004}.

\section{Decentralization}

TBD: Qualitative evaluation of the level of decentralization of all sub-systems.

\section{Resilience}

TBD: Qualitative evaluation of crashes and attacks, according to the trust model, that the network might experience and the result of experiments that simulate their occurrence.

\section{Performance}

TBD: For all metrics, an abstract analysis in function of the number of nodes in the network is performed, knowing the behaviour of the underlying Novinet primitives, to assess scaling. In addition, an empirical statistical analysis is performed.
